# License

In general, for personal use only as detailed below.

I'm still deciding on what the final license will be, so until then, you may pull this code for the purpose of building the pixeus.prg (final build file) and may run it with the CX16 emulator for your personal use. Don't distribute the code, reuse any of it in another project, or distribute the pixeus.prg file.
